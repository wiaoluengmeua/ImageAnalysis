Scripts that are complex enough not to fit in any of the other simple categories.
TOC

Affine transform objects between images.groovy - used with the Align images experimental tool in v0.2.0m1

Background staining check - Takes annotations, expands an area around them, checks the staining level in that area, 
then deletes all expanded areas and any original areas that violate some condition. Can help check for staining artifacts.

Classifier with GUI.groovy - User interface based macro to simplify classifying many possible channels. Also generates all
possible combinations of base classes (double, triple, etc positives).
*Added updated version for 0.2.0M5

Classifier with no GUI.groovy - Same as above but streamlined for use in a script, with no user interaction.

*Added Detection based versions of both above scripts which should work for tiles.

DBSCAN 0.2.0.groovy - Implementation of DBSCAN for cluster analysis.

Hotspot Detection 0.2.0M8.groovy - Detecting clusters of cells above a certain density and size threshold, written for 0.2.0M8

Invasion assay or tumor adjacent area.groovy - Creating areas of increasing distance from the tumor annotation border. Use negative 
values in the annotation expansion for invasion assays.

Lipid detection and measurement.groovy - Detects lighter areas within your tissue area and creates detection objects with measurements.

Multiple cell detections.groovy - Set of scripts that allow the user to run one cell detection, store those results, run a second cell
detection, and then import the results of the first. Useful when one set of Cell detection variables does not accurately detect all 
of your cells.

Positive Pixel scripting for QP 1.2.groovy - Demonstrates ways to succesfully use positive pixel detection to handle difficult staining.

Positive Pixel scripting for QP 1.3.groovy - Same as above but modified for alterations to positive pixel detection in 1.3

R-squared.groovy - GUI based R squared calculator-allows selection of objects by class. Only works for detections.
Added Plots and ability to save/export results of multiple calculations

R-squared pixel values.groovy - GUI based R squared calculator for pixel values in objects, combination of the R-squared and
colocalization scripts

RareCellFetcher-allAnnotations.groovy - Totally higher class than CellTinder or CellRoulette.

Step 1 through Step 4 - Part of a workflow for semiautomated generation of very high resolution cells. User defines the cytoplasm.

Tissue detection (for workflow) - Two scripts that mimic Simple Tissue Detection from QuPath, but give more channel flexibility when
working with fluorescent images. Normally QuPath will only use the first channel for tissue detection, while this will let you choose
the balance between channels that works best for you. Workflow version removes the GUI.

Tissue detection m5 - update to the scripts to work with version m5

Tumor Region Measurements - Script is from Pete and can be used for measurements in and around a tumor.

Updated Jan 2019 with Classifier scripts to make it easier to... well, classify. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qupath-users/LMxYihQMvTw

Updated Dec 2018 with a Tissue Detection script that can act in a similar (rough) fashion to simple tissue detection, but has the
advantage of allowing the user to choose and weight channels. This makes it possible to look at specific areas within tissue 
samples, even in 7-8 color images. See here for examples and an explanation: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qupath-users/4g26bLOC_CE
