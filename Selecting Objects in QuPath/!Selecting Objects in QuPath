Scripts mostly taken from Pete, and also from the forums.  For easy access and reference.  
Covers both Selecting, which is necessary to run most commands like cell detection, and collecting objects into a variable
for processing.  The latter is more efficient when you do not need to run a command like cell detection.

TOC 

A Selection guide.groovy - not actually a script, just a collection of useful tips.

Access top level objects.groovy - Creates a list of all objects at the "top" of the hierarchy. This list is dynamic.

Decendant and child objects.groovy - Shows accessing child objects or decendant objects.

Get objects within another object.groovy - ignores hierarchy in case of overlaps!

SelectClassificationsByName.groovy - Select objects based on their classifications having certain words

Selecting objects within a drawn annotation.groovy - <- What it says. Removes the drawn/selected annotation.

Selecting objects touching an annotation.groovy - uses Geometry functions to determine if the edges of objects are touching.

Testing selection models.groovy - For my reference.

Using selectionModel for groups of objects.groovy - Very basic example of creating a selection based on some thresholding.
