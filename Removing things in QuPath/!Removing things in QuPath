Scripts mostly taken from Pete, and also from the forums. For easy access and reference.

TOC

Remove detections outside annotations.groovy - Removes detections without a parent object.

Removing measurements by Weka file.groovy - Uses the results of Weka classification analysis of your training set 
to select the "best" measurements plus any specific ones you want to keep. Then it removes the rest. Use this to clean up
large amounts measurements like LBP, Haralick, Smoothed etc.

Removing measurements by keyword.groovy - Variant of the above, but clean up your measurement lists by keyword. Useful for 
removing ALL smoothed measurements as part of a script.

Remove objects by class name.groovy - Remove objects that have a class with a certain string in the name

Remove subcells after 0.2.0m5.groovy - collect and remove subcellular detections

Removing small annotation bits.groovy - Cleans up small tissue bits, though this can often be done by using better settings
during Simple Tissue Detection. Can be useful if your script fragments your annotations at a later point.

removing specific annotations.groovy - An example of deleting objects by creating a list, then removing the objects in the list.



Generally you will want to remove objects either by selecting them and using:
clearSelectedObjects(false);
or creating a list and using:
removeObjects(yourList,true)

True and false in the above statements indicate whether you also want to remove objects within the object you are deleting,
such as cells within an annotation.  True indicates that you want to keep the contained objects, while false removes everything.
