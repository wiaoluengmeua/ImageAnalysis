Annotation subtraction example.groovy - An example of creating and subtracing ROIs through scripting

Create annotation of fixed size.groovy - see https://petebankhead.github.io/qupath/scripting/2018/03/09/script-create-fixed-size-region.html

Create object based on Viewer position.groovy - Creates an object at the Viewer position. In this case a rectangle. Useful if you want
to create the exact same size object multiple times and then move it to an area of interest for subsampling.

Creating a TMA from script.groovy - Creates a basic TMA, which you would need to then manually position. Easiest to start small and then
add rows and columns through the QuPath TMA menu.

Creating TMA annotations and set missing by area.groovy - Takes a grid, runs a tissue detection (edit this to your own), and then set
missing and delete annotations in any cores below a threshold.

TMA Dearrayer from a script.groovy - More options for the TMA dearrayer than through the GUI. Read through the script carefully.

Tumor invasion areas.groovy - Generates annotation bands from the surface of the tumor inward. Can be used on tumors on the
surface of the tissue (bordering whitespace), but check the link included in the script.


Use points to place cells.groovy - mark locations using the Points tool, then place cells of a given class/size on top of each point.

Zstack or Time series full image annotations.groovy - Go through all layers of a Z stack or time series and place a full image annotation
in each.

Zstack or time series annotation copy.groovy - Similar to previous, but take all current annotations, and copy them to ALL OTHER time 
or Z frames.
