Collections of scripts to alter object colors harvested mainly from Pete, but also picked up from the forums
TOC

Change IF channel color.groovy - Change the LUT for individual channels. Does not work with OpenSlide servers (check Image tab).

Change colors by subclass.groovy - Detection object color adjustment when using subclasses.

Change subcellular detection color - Hugely useful when working with subcellular detections as, by default, they are a derived class
and cannot be altered directly through the Annotation tab interface.

Density heatmap by class.groovy - Add a measurement to cells that can be used to visually identify hotspots per class

Density heatmap by class with blur.groovy - better looking heatmap than above.

Heatmap for channels.groovy - Apply a LUT to a channel, instead of the default solid colors

Invert LUT of selected channels.groovy

Measurement map buttons.groovy - create some fixed buttons to make viewing consistent measurement maps much easeier.

Measurement Maps color lock.groovy - set fixed values for the measurement maps. Useful when comparing two images to each other and
keeping the same relative color display values.

Measurement Maps in 0.2.0.groovy - a code example for how to use measurement maps in version 0.2.0

Rename and recolor a class.groovy - <-- what it says

Show specific classes of objects v3.groovy - adds in checkboxes for groups of similarly named classes

Specific Object Color changes.groovy - A way of cycling through objects and set each object to a different color

TMA heatmap by color.groovy - Create detection objects in each TMA core, giving them measurements that are summaries of what is 
in the core. When Measurement maps are used and one of the summary measurments is selected, the whole TMA turns into a heatmap

From Gitter:
If you have a class already created, you can alter the color for that class (replace pathClass with the class)

pathClass.setColor(getColorRGB(0, 200, 0))

This requires having the class as a variable, for example:
stroma = getPathClass('Stroma')

recolored would be:
stroma.setColor(getColorRGB(0, 200, 0))
